	abstract = {Recent advances in sample preparation and sequencing technology have made it possible to profile the transcriptomes of individual cells using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-Seq). Compared to bulk RNA-Seq data, single-cell data often contain a higher percentage of zero reads, mainly due to lower sequencing depth per cell, which affects mostly measurements of low-expression genes. However, discrepancies between platforms are observed regardless of expression level. Using four paired datasets with multiple samples each, we investigated technical and biological factors that can contribute to this expression shift. Using two separate machine learning models we found that, in addition to expression level, RNA integrity, gene or UTR3 length, and the number of transcripts potentially also influence the occurrence of zeros. These findings could enable the development of novel analytical methods for cross-platform expression shift correction. We also identified genes and biological pathways in our diverse datasets that consistently showed differences when assessed at the single cell versus bulk level to assist in interpreting analysis across transcriptomic platforms. At the gene level, 25 genes (0.12\%) were found in all datasets as discordant, but at the pathway level, 7 pathways (2.02\%) showed shared enrichment in discordant genes.,

              In comparative high-throughput sequencing assays, a fundamental task is the analysis of count data, such as read counts per gene in RNA-seq, for evidence of systematic changes across experimental conditions. Small replicate numbers, discreteness, large dynamic range and the presence of outliers require a suitable statistical approach. We present
              DESeq2
              , a method for differential analysis of count data, using shrinkage estimation for dispersions and fold changes to improve stability and interpretability of estimates. This enables a more quantitative analysis focused on the strength rather than the mere presence of differential expression. The
              DESeq2
              package is available at
              http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DESeq2.html
